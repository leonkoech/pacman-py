# vaxman

## Vaxman is a game similar to pacman but with a twist.

+ Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
+ Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
+ Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
+ The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.

## Gameplay

The gameplay below encompasses the above idea. The only difference is the infections multiply every 5 seconds.
